                    <p class="teqst" >I'm a passionate,<a href="https://www.figma.com/@shahsagarm">  self-proclaimed designer </a> who specializes in full stack <br> development (React.js &
                        Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the <br> technical and visual aspects of digital
                        products to life. User experience, pixel <br> perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly
                        performant code matters to <br> me <br><br>
                        I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued <br> to grow and evolve
                        as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the <br> latest technologies along the way.
                        Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after <br> starting my web development journey, I'm building
                        cutting-edge web <br> applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, <br>
                        Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more. <br> <br>
                        I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to <br> end, from ideation all
                        the way to development. <br> <br>
                        When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on <br> twitter or on indie
                        hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying <br> some free time. You can follow me
                        on Twitter where I share tech-related bites <br> and build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub. <br><br>
                        Finally, some quick bits about me. <br><br>
